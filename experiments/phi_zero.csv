"This is really long, and will affect server startup to query time. Do you have quantitative evidence that this is required?",performance,False,"The provided code snippet is an example of a FastAPI application lifespan function that sets up and teardown services for a LangFlow server. The lifespan function is designed to initialize services, load configurations, and handle teardown processes when the server is shutting down. The code includes a diff section that highlights changes made to the original code.

The diff section shows a modification in the `delayed_init_mcp_servers` function. The original code had an `await asyncio.sleep(3.0)` line, which introduced a delay of 3 seconds before attempting to initialize MCP servers. This delay was likely intended to prevent race conditions with the MCP server startup.

The modified code replaces the 3-second delay with a 10-second delay (`await asyncio.sleep(10.0)`). This change increases the delay, allowing more time for starter projects to be created before attempting to initialize the MCP servers. The reasoning behind this change could be to ensure that all necessary components are ready before starting the MCP servers, reducing the likelihood of errors or race conditions during the initialization process.

The diff section also includes a comment that explains",phi,zero_shot,39.859332400000085,3586,256,3842,52.87632768361577,2107.615121232568,0.5854486447868242,0.0956937799043062,0.0096618357487922,0.0574162679425837,1

Let's break down the changes and their implications:

### Changes Made:

1. **Use of NumPy and NumPy-compatible libraries:**
   - The code now explicitly checks if `xp` (a placeholder for the array module) is `None` and defaults to using NumPy if it is. This ensures that the code can work with both NumPy arrays and NumPy-compatible libraries like CuPy for GPU acceleration.
   - The `xp` variable is used to create arrays, which allows the function to be more flexible and work with different array modules.

2. **Handling of `pos` parameter:**
   - The `pos` parameter determines the position within the window where the coefficients are evaluated. If `pos` is `None`, it defaults to the middle of the window.
   - The code now flips the array `x` when `use` is set to 'conv', which is",phi,zero_shot,36.880204980000144,2991,256,3247,55.52164634146342,2047.649697900246,0.5687915827500684,0.1897233201581027,0.0398406374501992,0.1027667984189723,0
