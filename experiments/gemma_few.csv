"I don't really like this change. 
It's kind of we allow to add something without validation. 
We have no control of `~/.docker/config.json` entries there why we may be forced to review some false positive issues related to user environment.

I may need a bit more context, sound like user looking for a proxy config during the build process, and I may be mistaken here but the issue happen when we run Docker-out-of-Docker configuration using `build.py` and user is behind the proxy.

I suppose it's better to add a flag for users `--use-user-docker-config` and add value accordingly if flag is given.",security,False,"```json
